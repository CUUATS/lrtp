Paving these roadways will allow all weather access without having to contact ATCT. Preliminary wildlife assessment has noted that gravel roads are a bird attractant. 2018 Entitlement.
2019,Construct Runway 4/22 Parallel,"$4,900,000 ",A parallel Runway 4/22 will give the GA flight school a viable cross wind runway without interruption to traffic on the higher category runway.
2019,Construct Perimeter Roadway System,"$2,000,000 ",Existing perimeter of the Airport is unreachable by exterior pavements and is not readily accessible. Project would continue the existing aggregate perimeter roads that have been constructed. Discretionary Seeking
