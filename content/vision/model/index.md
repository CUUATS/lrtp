With the analysis of existing transportation, socio-economic, land use, and
environmental conditions of Champaign County (in some aspects) and the
Champaign-Urbana urbanized area identified, a process was needed to determine
what planning actions are most supportive of the goals and objectives identified
for the planning horizon. CUUATS has adopted a scenario planning process in
order to evaluate the most important and uncertain elements in the future of the
planning area. Each scenario is analyzed through the CUUATS modeling suite in
order to understand the potential impacts of future planning decisions on
transportation, the environment, and society.

CUUATS maintains a suite of interconnected models that provide a holistic
approach to planning analysis. CUUATS has used travel demand modeling for
various projects over the last ten years, including long range transportation
planning and corridor studies. While preparing the previous LRTP, Choices 2035,
a need was identified for more comprehensive modeling that could improve our
understanding of the interactions between land use and transportation, as well
as the impacts of transportation on livability, social costs, greenhouse gas
emissions, and public health. Since 2009 CUUATS staff has worked to incorporate
and refine additional models for various transportation planning processes. This
LRTP, Sustainable Choices 2040, utilizes the four county-level models detailed
below and two additional models used to evaluate conditions at a more local
scale (the Health Impact Assessment [HIA] and the Local Accessibility and
Mobility Analysis [LAMA]), detailed in appendices B and C). After running the
models to establish an existing conditions scenario using the year 2010 as a
baseline, two alternative scenarios were developed in order to help evaluate the
potential impact of future planning decisions on the community through the year
2040, Traditional Development 2040 and Sustainable Choices 2040.

### Traditional Development 2040
The Traditional Development 2040 scenario represents the expected state of the
planning area in 2040 based on historic transportation system growth trends and
patterns. Projections of population and employment were reviewed with municipal
officials, and relatively certain future development projects were included
(Figure 11.1).

### Sustainable Choices 2040
The Sustainable Choices 2040 scenario is designed to incorporate input collected
from the public as summarized in the planning pillars described in Chapter 8. In
this scenario, a high speed rail corridor between Chicago and the Illinois
Terminal in downtown Champaign is one of the main catalysts of downtown growth.
In addition, an intensive transit corridor system helps link downtown Urbana and
Champaign, as well as facilitate increased density on and around University
Avenue and Campustown. Business and research commuters are better served by the
rail link to Chicago, which enables increased growth in the Research Park.
Transit service is expanded through additional routes and increased frequency of
some existing routes. Another significant growth area for light industrial
development is predicted on and around Olympian Drive and Lincoln Avenue, which
would justify the extension of Olympian Avenue to US-45 (Figure 11.2).

## Projecting Population and Employment

### Population

HandyAndy is an interregional cohort-component model, created by Dr. Andy
Isserman at the University of Illinois, that produces countylevel population
projections1. After entering county demographic data, (including population, in-
and out-migration, birth, and death data - all by age and gender), HandyAndy
guides the user through the hundreds of calculations entailed in an
interregional cohort-component projection. CUUATS staff used population data
from the Census and local birth and death data from the CU Public Health
District and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and referenced municipal
zoning maps and comprehensive plans for existing conditions and future land use
plans.

To produce traffic analysis zone (TAZ) level population projections, the total
projected county population from each projection year was distributed throughout
the county according to the 2010 population proportion of each TAZ. Some TAZs
did not receive any population increases if they were already at population
capacity or if they were unlikely or unable to be developed within the planning
horizon due to environmental or infrastructure barriers. Population is expected
to continue to shift from rural to urban, and a migration rate of 2.46% every
ten years reassigned some population from the rural TAZs to the urban TAZs.
Finally, staff met with municipal officials in Urbana, Champaign, Savoy, and
Mahomet to evaluate the projection numbers as well as provide information about
future developments that could impact population in each TAZ through 2040. This
additional input was used to manually adjust the projections through 2040.

### Employment

TrenDandy is an Excel workbook with worksheets and charts for making employment
projections using Regional Economic Information System (REIS) data, also created
by Dr. Isserman. TrenDandy was used to produce countylevel employment
projections through 2040 using geo-coded Business Analyst industry employment
data for the 2010 base year. The Business Analyst data was cross-referenced with
the Champaign County Economic Development Corporation and individual employers
when necessary.

Projections were based on rates from previous years of county level North
American Industry Classification System (NAICS) employment data which were then
forecasted with reference to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) employment
history as well as national, state, and area employment projections from other
agencies. TrenDandy’s county-level projection rates through 2040 by NAICS code
were applied in each TAZ according to projected industry growth rates. The
precise geographic locations in the 2010 base year business data allows the
projections to use more accurate industry segmentation estimates that vary for
each TAZ. After projecting the industry groups forward through 2040, they were
summed to produce total employment for each TAZ, and these numbers were also
reviewed and edited by municipal officials for further refinement.

## Modeling and Results

### Travel Demand Model (TDM)

The Champaign County travel demand model is a person trip model built using the
Cube Voyager software platform. The TDM employs the traditional four-step travel
forecasting process to evaluate auto and transit trips for both daily and peak
hour scenarios. The countywide travel demand model is integrated with the Land
Use Evolution and Impact Assessment Model (LEAM) to identify the relationships
between land use changes and travel patterns in the region. The base year for
the model is 2010. Due to the unique relationship between the TDM and LEAM,
multiple horizon year forecasts can be evaluated.

The TDM models trips for all purposes, including work, school, shopping, and
other trips. Table 11.2 reports the daily home-based work trips in the urbanized
area, which are the largest component of total vehicle miles traveled and thus
the largest driver of congestion, emissions, and cost.

The Sustainable Choices 2040 scenario for anticipates over 13,000 more employed
persons in the county by 2040 compared to the Traditional Development 2040
scenario, yet the amount of work trips made using single occupancy vehicles
remains nearly constant. This is a result of an increased number of home to work
trips made using transit, bicycling, or walking due to improved and expanded
infrastructure for those modes.

CUUATS TDM was utilized to measure levels of congestions during peak hours
within the urbanized area roadway network. Levels of congestion were determined
based on Volume (V) to Capacity (C) ratio values of different roadway segments
during the peak hours. Table 11.4 shows congestion levels defined by the V/C
ratio. For Travel Demand Model documention, see Appendix F.

### Land Use (LEAM)
The Land Use Evolution and Impact Assessment Model (LEAM) is a suite of
interconnected attractor models that predict land use change developed at the
University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign1. LEAM is linked with the other
CUUATS models in the suite, and most tightly with the Travel Demand Model (TDM).
LEAM and the TDM run in an iterative pattern every five years from 2010 to 2040.
This enables the growth patterns developed by LEAM to respond to any congestion
that appears in the TDM over the next 25 years. The final 2040 output of LEAM
also provides detailed growth patterns.

Because LEAM models population and employment patterns at a finer resolution (on
a 30 x 30 meter square grid) than the TAZ level projections, it was necessary to
refine some of the projections to a smaller scale. The feedback from municipal
officials and knowledge of known developments was used to create targeted growth
zones so that the LEAM output would include these known developments. In the map
to the right, the colored zones are areas with specified population and/or
employment targets input into LEAM to estimate growth patterns as an output for
the 2040 planning horizon. Purple zones are used in both 2040 scenarios, and the
yellow zones are areas of higher growth expected only in the Sustainable Choices
2040 scenario, (Figure 11.4).
{{<image src="green.jpg"

LEAM assigns population and employment to the target areas (growth zones) and
after these areas have their targets fulfilled, LEAM takes the remaining
population and employment projected countywide and assigns it using its
attractor models. LEAM favors greenfield development unless explicitly
instructed to attempt redevelopment in the growth zones, leading to the
predominantly fringe development pattern seen in Figure 11.5. While this pattern
fits the Traditional Development 2040 scenario, CUUATS staff weren’t able to use
LEAM to accurately map the Sustainable Choices 2040 scenario.

### Mobile Source Emissions (MOVES)
The MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) model was developed by the
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Transportation and Air
Quality2. MOVES is required for use by states and metropolitan planning
organizations (MPO) where measurements of one or more pollutants exceed the
maximum allowable levels under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) and must be run at the county scale for all non-attainment areas.
Although the Champaign-Urbana urbanized area is currently an attainment area for
all emissions quality standards, CUUATS staff proactively includes MOVES in the
modeling suite to estimate the environmental impact of alternative planning
scenarios. This data also allows the region to continually track and better
understand how ongoing development affects emissions in order to remain an
attainment area.

In tables 11.8 and 11.9, the same annual mobile vehicle emission rates are shown
in different units of measurement. The tables show the Sustainable Choices 2040
scenario with a slightly higher emissions rate than the Traditional Development
2040 scenario. However, the increase relative to Traditional Development 2040 is
actually at a smaller rate on a per-capita basis. The results presented in
Figure 11.7 show emissions per resident and per employee are both smaller in the
Sustainable Choices 2040 scenario.

### Social Costs (SCALDS)
The Social Cost of Alternative Land Development Scenarios (SCALDS) model was
created in 1998 by Parsons Brinckerhoff and ECONorthwest for the Federal Highway
Administration3. The model tests the impacts of various scenarios of land
development that are often unforeseen by policymakers. It is a comprehensive
model of the initial costs of development (such as building out utilities),
ongoing maintenance costs, and externalities like travel time and natural
resource use. CUUATS staff have updated and reviewed the model using local data
for Champaign County.

Key differences between the Traditional Development 2040 and Sustainable Choices
2040 scenarios are the locations and types of residential development projected
(Figure 11.8). In the Traditional Development 2040 scenario, the overwhelming
majority of development is on the rural fringe of municipalities, while the
Sustainable Choices 2040 scenario shifts a significant portion of the expected
population growth to core areas of the community. The difference in the location
of new residents also influences the density of new development. Based on SCALDS
results, the increased density of the Sustainable Choices 2040 scenario reduces
the new infrastructure cost by 25% compared to the Traditional Development 2040
scenario.

The annual operational costs for Sustainable Choices 2040 are slightly lower
than the Traditional Development scenario. Since the Sustainable Choices 2040
scenario has more miles traveled due to the increased number of employees, the
annual operational cost is projected to be slightly higher, but it’s quite a bit
less than it could have been if that scenario didn’t have a mode shift towards
transit. Projected costs were not adjusted for future inflation.

Increased density also saves on resource usage. The Sustainable Choices 2040
scenario saves nearly 150,000 gallons of water4 per day compared to the
Traditional Development 2040 scenario, despite having nearly 5,000 more
residents (Figure 11.8). Transportation costs are also held down by increased
development in core areas of Urbana and Champaign. Due to an increase in the
proportion of workers using transit, walking, or cycling to work, total
transportation cost is only marginally higher even with a significantly
increased workforce in the Sustainable Choices 2040 scenario (Figure 11.9).

## Health Imapct Assessment

As mentioned in Chapter 6: Health, CUUATS staff recently completed an extensive
Health Impact Assessment (HIA) to analyze the impact of transportation and the
built environment on population health in the Champaign-Urbana area. HIA is a
policy analysis tool that can be used to formalize public health considerations
in planning processes. The most direct impact of the built environment on health
is in regard to levels of physical activity, which are closely linked to
obesity. Moreover, obesity has been strongly linked to heart diseases, various
types of cancer, and other cardiovascular diseases. As such, the HIA was
designed to establish a robust relationship between the built environment and
the local obesity rate. The analysis revealed that there were significant
correlations between obesity and different built environment variables such as
density, service accessibility, transit connectivity, active transportation
infrastructure and more. Obesity rates were generally lower in neighborhoods
that had higher population density, better land use mix, higher accessibility to
jobs and services, and better transit connectivity. Based on the results of the
HIA, a health index was developed that was used to rate the built environment
variables of different planning areas in terms of their impact on levels of
physical activity and local health.

An important limitation related to studying the relationships between different
health conditions and the transportation system is that correlations do not
necessarily prove causation. Many illnesses and health conditions reveal
themselves in different ways in different people and result from intersections
of multiple factors and risk modifiers. The findings of this study should not be
interpreted as asserting that the transportation system is the only factor that
determines health outcomes in the community. At the same time, scientific
evidence asserts that even small increases in active transportation could lead
to significant decreases in chronic disease and increases in overall public
health, which makes this a unique opportunity for CUUATS to facilitate positive
change in the health of the community. For more information about the
Champaign-Urbana HIA, see Appendix B for the full report.

## Local Accessibility and Mobility Analysis

Similar in scope to the HIA, CUUATS staff recently completed the Local
Accessibility and Mobility Analysis (LAMA) that attempts to characterize the
accessibility and mobility of different planning areas in the Champaign- Urbana
urbanized area. This was a more qualitative analysis that sought to evaluate the
availability of choices related primarily to travel behavior in different
neighborhoods. The general conclusion of the analysis was that the combination
of mobility and accessibility has a significant impact on travel behavior and
transportation costs. Residents living in neighborhoods that have high
accessibility to various services (e.g. jobs, grocery stores, and other
services), and high mobility (measured in terms of availability of bus routes,
bike lanes, sidewalks, etc.) were more likely to use active modes of
transportation and have lower transportation costs. This is the same conclusion
as the HIA whereby neighborhoods with high accessibility and high mobility had
significantly lower rates of obesity. A detailed report outlining the
methodologies and results of LAMA can be found in Appendix C.
