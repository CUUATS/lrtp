Implementing the LRTP is not only about completing the projects identified in
the plan but also taking steps to incorporate the broader goals and objectives
and strategies identified within each of the planning pillars in addition to
those established in MAP-21. As evidenced by the myriad issues that came up
during the public involvement portions of the plan, the transportation network
is intricately tied to many other conditions in the community such as land-use,
public health, the environment, and the economy. The overall built environment
operates most effectively when all these different processes can work together
to facilitate safe and efficient access and mobility from different points in
the community to serve each of our daily needs.

## Routine Implementation Tasks

Plan implementation also involves certain standard routine tasks that can be
considered on two levels: project-related implementation, and concept-related
implementation. These tasks are as necessary as fulfilling our goals and
objectives and constructing transportation projects.

### Project-Related Tasks

_Review Project Priorities Periodically_ Projects in the LRTP have undergone an
initial prioritization process; this prioritization should be reviewed
periodically to include new projects and change priorities if new funding or
information becomes available. This can be aided by continuing to complete the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) every year and update it as needed.

_Geographically Unite Nearby Projects_ Attempts should be made during initial
project prioritization and in later revisions to unite geographically adjacent
projects. If an on-street bike lane is planned on the same road where widening
will occur, these projects should be joined in order to save money and time.

_Keep a Record of Prioritized Projects and Their Implementation_ As a benchmark
for completing the plan, project lists should be reviewed with each five-year
update of the LRTP. A progress map should be included in each subsequent LRTP
update to show project progress during each five-year period.

_Seek New Funding Resources_ Local agencies should continually seek new funding
sources for those projects that do not currently have funding. When the new
federal transportation bill is enacted, local agencies should determine
potential funding sources and pursue projects that fit the intent of the new
bill.

### Concept-Related Tasks

_Complete Benchmarks from Plan_ Performance Measures are based on the LRTP goals
and objectives as well as the project lists; they are measurable events that
signify progress and/or lack of progress toward defined goals. Every effort
should be made to update data sets related to the Performance Measures and
produce the LRTP Report Card each year.

_Update Plan_ By federal law, the LRTP must be updated at least every five
years. New information relevant to the transportation system, funding or
specific projects can be cause for amending the LRTP prior to the fiveyear
update.

_Determine Responsible Parties_ Each benchmark and transportation project
requires participation by different local, regional, state, and federal
agencies. All parties involved should be clear on their responsibilities in
implementing the LRTP, and should act upon them accordingly.

_Monitor Area Development_ While the LRTP is based on local agencies’ most
available knowledge at the time of writing, many new developments may occur
while other anticipated developments may not occur on time or at all. Decision
making processes and future updates to the plan should reflect these changes.

_Evaluate Change_ Proactive planning should be utilized to anticipate changes to
the transportation network. Where unanticipated changes occur, local agencies
should assess how unanticipated changes will affect the transportation system,
and react to those changes logically and efficiently.

_Revise Forecasts_ Population and employment forecasts should be revised with
each five-year LRTP update or when it is clear that a development that was not
anticipated in the previous LRTP will have a significant impact on the
transportation system. If a decennial Census takes place between LRTP updates,
adjustments may be made to the LRTP through an amendment process if necessary.

_Update Models_ The CUUATS Modeling Suite must be updated as continually as
staff and funding permit. Updated traffic volumes, population forecasts,
employment forecasts, and other inputs are essential elements to have accurate
working models.

_Seek Funding for Implementation_ Some of the goals and objectives will require
significant staff time or other inputs to be completed. Funding must be sought
for both transportation projects and concepts implementation.

_Develop a Freight Plan_ Without a local truck route system in place, trucks can
travel on any road between these state truck routes to load or unload, which can
create congestion, raise safety concerns, and increase wear and tear on roads
that were not constructed to handle commercial truck traffic.

_Complete a Curtis Road Planning Corridor Study_ The section of Curtis Road
between First Street and IL-130 is proposed for a Corridor Planning Study to
determine a context-sensitive design that will increase safety for all road
users while remaining compatible with adjacent land uses.

## Sucessful Plan Implementation: Obstacles

Bringing the projects and concepts in this plan to fruition will require public
officials, local government staff, and residents to seek a fresh perspective on
how our community functions and how they want it to function in the future. If
the transportation network fails to evolve to accommodate changing social,
economic, and health trends, our community will experience longer travel times,
more roadways with congestion, fewer opportunities to promote mode shift, and
the inability to realize the social, environmental, and health goals set forth
in this plan. Diverging from the status quo requires openness to new ideas. In
order to realize these goals, there are numerous obstacles to overcome.

### Safety and Security

This planning pillar defines safety and security as including crash data
statistics, tracking and understanding regional commodity flows as they relate
to hazardous materials and potential exposure, and coordinating with agencies in
charge of emergency vehicle access.

**Obstacle:** According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), automobile crashes are the
leading cause of death for those aged 5-34 in the United States. Despite the
best efforts of transportation planners, engineers, and vehicle operators, cars
remain a dangerous form of transportation due to their speed and the
inevitability of human error.

**Obstacle:** The Champaign-Urbana area does not currently have a high level of awareness
regarding hazardous material locations and transportation routes. CUUATS staff
is currently undertaking the task of completing a study that will detail
hazardous material locations and transportation routes in the area that will
include the identification of vulnerable locations and corresponding
recommendations for specific routes that minimize risks for area residents and
environmental health.

**Obstacle:** While there currently exist many opportunities for road users to become more
educated about how to safety share the road with different modes, this community
has a relatively high population turnover rate due to the nature of the student
population and academic calendar. Targeted and periodic efforts should be
implemented to target temporary residents for transportation safety outreach.

### Resilient Economy

If a transportation system cannot adequately support residents, businesses, and
institutions, economic growth is hampered. This in turn negatively affects
quality of life and the vitality of a community. Links between investment in new
transportation capacity and economic growth need to be analyzed to ensure
decisions are in the best interest of the community.

**Obstacle:** Economic development considerations sometimes focus on short-term
payoffs at the expense of established plans and long-term costs. The goal of
economic growth is sometimes sought without consideration for the transportation
infrastructure that would be needed to adequately service the area. Local
government officials need to plan and provide for adequate transportation
infrastructure in order to facilitate development in an efficient and cost
effective fashion rather than the current pattern of building infrastructure for
specific projects. This would help facilitate more efficient expenditure of tax
revenues. Requests for incentives or assistance that are inconsistent with
established plans should be subjected to close scrutiny and evaluated for their
net benefits over the long term.

**Obstacle:** Transportation planners currently have limited information regarding
the relationships between area businesses and the transportation network. In
order to better facilitate economic development and meet the changing needs of
existing business owners and entrepreneurs, planners should be better educated
about how, why, and when area businesses use the different transportation modes
in the region. RPC staff is currently working with the Champaign County Economic
Development Corporation on a project that will document area business uses and
needs for the transportation system to help address this deficiency.

### Multimodal Connectivity

The vision for 2040 calls for an increase in active modes of transportation and
a decrease in personal vehicle use. Such a shift in mode choice would take some
cars off the roadways, thus decreasing congestion, lessening air pollution,
reducing roadway expenditures, and improving population health by increasing
daily physical activity. In order for residents to change their travel habits,
facilities for active modes of transportation must become more accessible,
affordable, and efficient.

**Obstacle:** Because cars are such a dominant form of travel, alternative forms of
transportation are often seen as less convenient or more timeconsuming. It will
be important to improve facilities for active modes of transportation so that
they can be more appealing than driving a car in locations where active
transportation is feasible and convenient. Ideally, the transit service area
would be expanded to be coterminous with the urbanized area and transit service
would be able to offer more direct routes and high capacity routes along major
corridors, linking residential developments to large employers and other popular
destinations. The amount of funding local transit agencies are able to secure
will likely help determine how effective our public transit system can be.

**Obstacle:** Current development patterns cause many people to be dependent on
their cars. Land use policies and ordinances regulating development are tailored
toward suburban style development, making it more difficult and/or expensive to
incorporate higher density development into the current mix. Higher density
development makes the use of active transportation more accessible by reducing
walking, biking, and transit distances. Local land use policies could strengthen
existing incentives for higher density in both the core and fringe of the
urbanized area.

**Obstacle:** Funding for pedestrian and bicycle projects tend to lose priority
behind roadway projects. In addition, adding active transportation mode
facilities to the existing roadway network, such as public transit stops, bike
facilities, and sidewalks, can be difficult due to limited space on or adjacent
to existing roadways. When feasible, residents should be open to providing right
of way or allowing easements on their properties when such facilities are deemed
necessary for the proper functioning of the local transportation system. These
facilities should be added where possible during new construction or the
reconstruction of existing roadways to create Complete Streets in accordance
with the CUUATS Complete Street Policy.

### Accessibility and Affordability

Major arterial routes that traverse the urbanized area need to operate under
conditions that guarantee all road users a high level of mobility and an
affordable way to access vital services in a safe manner. CUUATS Access
Management Guidelines provide a tool for implementation that considers elements
such as location and spacing of at-grade intersections with other roadways,
location and configuration of medians, location and spacing of private
driveways, etc. Since major highway corridor improvements can be costly,
implementation of corridor management strategies are critical to preserve public
investment in roadways and improve capacity. Implemented in conjunction with
CUUATS Complete Streets Policy, higher access for walking, biking, and public
transit will also provide more affordable access options for all road users.

Transportation system users benefit from standardized signage, markings, and
facilities while traveling. Staff has developed several sets of guidelines that,
if implemented, would make our roadways and pedestrian/bicycle facilities safer
and more user-friendly. Guidelines for Accessible Pedestrian Signals,
streetscaping, crosswalk installation, and trails facilities are all available
in existing CUUATS documents and plans.

**Obstacle:** Corridor management can be challenging because it involves both transportation
and land use issues. Negotiating with business owners and property owners to
close access points can be difficult because a perception exists that more
access points mean more business, and closing them will turn customers away.
Access management should be included as part of roadway projects in high traffic
corridors to complete construction on the roadway and close access points where
possible at the same time. This will save time, money, and reduce the
disturbance to businesses along the corridor. State and local agencies should
work together on corridor management plans and enter into intergovernmental
agreements during roadway projects involving multiple jurisdictions.

**Obstacle:** Consensus-building among local government and private agencies to implement
common CUUATS guidelines is difficult because each jurisdiction likes having a
unique identity. Standards that are inconsistent between agencies can lead to
confusion for transportation system users. Local regulations also contribute to
developing and implementing any standards; sometimes changes in municipal codes
are required if new standards are to be introduced. In addition, funding for
implementation of multi-jurisdiction standards is not always available from all
agencies at the same time.

**Obstacle:** The different guidelines established by CUUATS need to be updated on a regular
basis to account for changes in standards, techniques and new technology. Time
and money can be difficult to budget for such updates but are a necessary
component in keeping local standards in the urbanized area current with national
standards.

### Healthy Neighborhoods

In Champaign County, approximately 34% of adults are overweight and of those
34%, 27% are obese. Obesity can lead to many other health conditions but is
preventable; transportation planners should take advantage of the opportunity to
increase daily physical activity in order to reduce obesity by facilitating
active transportation. The 2014-2016 Champaign County Community Health
Improvement Plan lists obesity as one of four health priorities for Champaign
County.

**Obstacle:** The amount of daily physical activity each resident engages in is a personal
choice. Planners can’t make decisions for people, but can and should provide
appealing active transportation choices for people to facilitate healthier
lifestyles.

**Obstacle:** Despite the availability of good choices, illnesses result from intersections of
multiple factors and risk modifiers. There is no one thing that planners can to
do automatically improve population health. CUUATS intends to be a small part of
a larger approach to improve local health working with local health agencies and
municipalities in a coordinated effort.

### Balanced Development

Traveling between home, work, shopping, neighborhoods, and entertainment centers
often requires a lengthy journey that can be more difficult without a car. By
creating denser mixed-use areas in the community we can increase the share of
trips made using active modes of transportation. This development pattern allows
residents to walk, bike, or use public transit to travel between these activity
centers. In addition, focusing development within the existing municipal
boundaries will reduce greenfield development and associated expenditures for
service and roadway extensions.

**Obstacle:** Since land development is primarily a private sector activity regulated by the
public sector, stakeholder education and involvement is also critical to
success. The metropolitan planning organization (CCRPC) can play an important
role as a liaison between all parties.

**Obstacle:** Current land use policies provide incentives for mixed-use development and
higher densities, but these incentives are weak in comparison to the impacts of
federal and state policies that promote lower density, segregated development.
Stronger incentives and procedural changes can help address this obstacle.

**Obstacle:** New development occurs on a project by project basis and current development
standards do not adequately provide integrated pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and
motor vehicle facilities with those on adjacent sites. Site reviews for new
development should include steps to ensure connectivity for active modes of
transportation including walking and/or biking connections to transit stops
where appropriate. Site design and development standards should be reviewed and
improved cooperatively by the relevant jurisdictions in the urbanized area.

**Obstacle:** Consumer preferences, market forces, and government policies creating incentives
and disincentives can determine how a community develops. For the most part
these forces (e.g. interest rates, overall economic growth, state and federal
subsidies) are beyond local control. Local government policies can mitigate the
impact of these forces when carefully targeted and can exacerbate them if they
are ill-considered. Relevant policies are not just the familiar land use
regulations but also include building regulations, taxes, economic development
policies, and direct public investment in infrastructure and services. Local
governments in the urbanized area should continue to evaluate the impacts of all
their decisions as they affect urban form and development to ensure they create
no barriers to and effectively encourage compact, dense, mixed use,
transit-friendly development.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Champaign-Urbana region is already in a good position to
achieve the transportation goals set forth in this document because the
different municipalities that make up the region have been working on many of
these issues at the local level for years. In fact, the Champaign- Urbana area
has a national reputation for making prudent decisions about the ways in which
the region has grown over time. According to the organization, Smart Growth
America, in 2014 the Champaign-Urbana metropolitan area ranked number 5 in most
compact, connected metro areas out of all 221 metropolitan statistical areas and
994 counties in the nation based on a collective score of development density,
land-use mix, activity centering, and street accessibility (Measuring Sprawl
2014). In addition, the area is known for its active transportation behavior. In
2014 a Census Bureau report ranked the City of Urbana number 15 among small
cities in the United States for the number of residents who walk or ride a bike
to work. The City of Urbana, the City of Champaign, and the University of
Illinois all have achieved “bike-friendly” designation by the League of American
Bicyclists.

In order to track the implementation of the plan and the progress toward the
goals and objectives identified within it, CUUATS staff compiles an Annual
Report Card for the current LRTP to document changes in the data used to track
the goals and objectives. The report cards are posted publically on the CUUATS
website each year and they serve to provide greater transparency to the public
in terms of the function of the plan and how public input gets incorporated into
the planning process. The report cards also serve as a way for CUUATS member
agencies to revisit the goals and objectives on an annual basis and evaluate how
far the area is from attaining them, potential obstacles to attainment, and/or
if certain goals need to evolve or be removed to adapt to changing priorities or
conditions. Proactive planning must be used to foresee these changes as time
progresses so costly reactionary measures can be avoided. In summary, the
success of this plan depends on the effort local agencies and residents put into
its implementation.
