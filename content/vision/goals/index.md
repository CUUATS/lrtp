## Purpose
The formulation of goals and objectives determines what direction planning
efforts should take. A goal is defined as an end state that will be brought
about by implementing the LRTP. Objectives are sub-goals that help organize the
implementation of the plan into measurable and manageable parts. CUUATS staff
uses the SMART (specific, measurable, agreed, realistic, and timebound) acronym
to guide the objective development process. This LRTP update includes specific
strategies which will help agencies reach the stated goals and objectives, and
also includes specific performance measures to track progress toward the
completion of each goal and objective over time. All performance measures will
have a base year of 2015.

## Annual LRTP Report Card
The LRTP Annual Report Card includes updates for the Measures of Effectiveness
(MOEs, also known as ‘performance measures’) developed in 2009 for the LRTP
2035: Choices as a way to track and measure the progress that the Metropolitan
Planning Area (MPA) makes towards desired outcomes between each LRTP update. The
MOEs are a series of performance measures designed to provide agencies with
communication tools to bring to the public that show tangible evidence of the
changes taking place as a result of the transportation planning process.

MOEs are assigned a good, neutral, or negative rating depending on the data
trend. The MOEs compare conditions in the current year with the base year of
2009, which was when the goals and objectives were established. This provides an
understanding of the previous conditions and the current status in achieving the
goals set forth in LRTP 2035: Choices. This process enables staff to identify
strengths, weaknesses, and difficulties in achieving LRTP goals and planning for
the future. The practice of producing an Annual LRTP Report Card will be
continued for the LRTP: Sustainable Choices 2040 after it is approved.

The following is a summary of the MOEs documented in the 2013 Report Card for
the LRTP 2035: Choices.

### Land use MOEs
_Population Density and Land Area_ This MOE receives a positive rating because Urbana, Champaign, Savoy, and
Bondville all have increased densities from 2009 to 2013. In addition, there was
a slight increase in the amount of total land area of the Cities of Champaign
and Urbana in 2012 compared to 2009.

_Acreage per Land Use Category_ Available data indicates an increase of agricultural land from 2009 to 2013. New
data also suggests a shift in acreages in the Open Space categories towards
public open space and away from private open space. This MOE receives a neutral
rating until data inconsistencies can be corrected.

### Environmental MOEs
_Air Quality_ This MOE receives a neutral rating because of the mixed results in our region.
Although Particulate Matter and Ozone 1-hour pollutant levels have decreased in
measurements and were safely below state standards, Ozone 8-hour level
measurements were above the state standard for the second year in a row. Despite
this, the urbanized area continues to be an Illinois Air Attainment Area.

_water quality_ This MOE receives a negative rating because of the mixed and slightly worsened
results in our region. In 2008, portions of the Kaskaskia River and Copper
Slough were fully supporting aquatic life. In 2012, the Saline Branch and
Embarras River improved in water quality to support aquatic life. However, a
portion of the Kaskaskia River and a portion of the Copper Slough no longer
support aquatic life and Crystal Lake has been deemed to be Not Supportive of
fish consumption.

_wetlands_ This MOE receives a positive rating because of the 0.55% increase in the amount
of wetland acreage in the urbanized area since 2009 and no loss of wetlands
since the previous LRTP update.

### Transportation MOEs

_pedestrian crashes_ This MOE receives a negative rating because pedestrian crashes have increased
5.3% since 2009 in Champaign-Urbana area. Pedestrian fatalities decreased from
two in 2009 to one in 2012.

_accessible pedestrian signals_ This MOE receives a positive rating because the number of Accessible Pedestrian
Signals installed in the urbanized area has continued to increase. Seventeen APS
signals were installed in 2009, increasing the total to 36 in 2013. This
represents a 112% increase.

_Bicycle Crashes_ This MOE receives a positive rating because bicycle crashes have decreased 41%
since 2009, which is well above the 15% target set for 2014.

_Bicycle Facilities_ This MOE receives a positive rating because the total mileage of bike facilities
in the metropolitan planning area has increased 57% since 2009, which is well
above the goal of a 15% increase in dedicated bicycle facilities and signed
bicycle routes by 2014.

_hybrid buses_ This MOE receives a positive rating as the hybrid dieselelectric buses share has
increased significantly from 2009 to 2013. In 2013, 54% of C-U MTD’s fleet was
hybrid diesel-electric, up from 9% in 2009. As the urbanized area looks at
reducing greenhouse gases and carbon footprints, alternative energy vehicles
will play a significant role in achieving this goal.

_Bus Routes and Annual Ridership_ This MOE receives a positive rating as CU-MTD
ridership has increased 28.6% since 2009. This is well above the target of a 5%
increase of transit ridership by 2014. The highest monthly ridership for CU-MTD
in 2013 was 1,536,182 rides in October.

_Parcels Near Bus Routes_ This MOE receives a positive rating because there is
nearly 93% coverage of all residential land uses within a quarter of a mile of
CU-MTD bus routes. This surpasses the target of 90% coverage of all residential
land uses by 2014.

_New Roadways_ This MOE receives a positive rating because the new construction of
roadways for 2013 were within the municipal boundaries of our region.

_Pavement Condition_ This MOE receives a positive rating because 78% of the
roadways were in Excellent, Good or Fair condition in 2013, compared with 69% in
2009.

_Journey to Work_ This MOE receives a neutral rating despite the significant
increases in overall transit ridership since 2009. The 2011 percentage of 9.1%
transit commuters in the urbanized area surpassed the target of 9% by 2014.
Despite the fact that transit ridership continues to grow, the percent of people
commuting by transit within the urbanized area dropped to 8.2% in 2012 due to
the expansion of the Census-defined urbanized area boundary, which now includes
Tolono and other locations outside the C-U MTD service area.

_Total Crashes_ This MOE receives a positive rating because of the 7.1% decrease
in the total crashes per 100M VMT since 2009. This is 2.1 percentage points
above the target of a 5% decrease in crashes in the Champaign-Urbana area by
2014.

_Total Fatalities_ This MOE receives a positive rating because total fatalities
decreased by 25% since 2009, which meets the LRTP 2035 objective. In addidtion,
Champaign-Urbana area has remained below the IDOT target for the past four
years.

_“A” Injuries_ This MOE receives a neutral rating because “A” injuries per 100M
VMT only decreased 14% since 2009 within the Champaign- Urbana area. Although
any decrease in injuries is good, the Champaign- Urbana area is below the target
of a 25% reduction by 2014.

_Total Vehicle Miles Traveled_ This MOE receives a positive rating because of an
overall decrease in annual VMT, vehicle registration, and commercial truck
traffic volume since 2009. Maintaining total VMT while simultaneously
facilitating alternative modes of transporstation helps increase the capcity of
the existing transportation system while minimizing increases in infrastructure
and maintenance costs.

_Car Sharing_ This MOE receives a positive rating thanks to a contract with Zipcar
that began in 2009 with six cars. Since 2009, membership has increased and
Zipcar now has 16 cars in the urbanized area.

_Amtrak Ridership_ This MOE receives a positive rating because there was a
ridership increase of 38% since 2009. This is 23 percentage points above the
target of a 15% increase in boardings by 2014. Ridership continues to increase
each year, which bodes well for this performance measure in years to come.

_Willard Airport_ This MOE receives a negative rating due to a 25% decrease in
flights and a 3% decrease in enplanements between 2009 and 2013.

## Methodology

CUUATS staff, in conjunction with the LRTP Working Group, developed goals that
will lead local agencies in the implementation of the plan. These goals are
grouped according to the six Sustainable Choices 2040 planning pillars outlined
in the introduction and elaborated on in Chapter 8: Planning Pillars.

The goals and objectives were formulated based on a combination of the MAP-21
priorities, State of IL transportation policy factors, local knowledge, current
local planning efforts, and input received during Sustainable Choices 2040
public outreach. Additionally, some of the goals and objectives included in this
update were revised from those listed in the previous LRTP. Agencies are listed
under each set of strategies to delineate jurisdiction and/or responsibilities.
The goals, objectives, and strategies generally represent concepts by which
projects should be identified, designed, and constructed.

Finally, specific performance measures were developed to help CUUATS staff track
the progress of each objective during the five year period between LRTP updates
according to relevant and obtainable data. Each performance measure is listed in
the same row as its specific objective in the proceeding tables. Each table
shows the goals, objectives, performance measures, strategies, and the parties
responsible for implementation. All the performance measures have a base year of
2015.
