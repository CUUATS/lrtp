A long range transportation plan’s (LRTP) purpose is to assess the existing and
future transportation infrastructure over a 25-year horizon for an area of urban
development known as the metropolitan planning area (MPA). The LRTP planning
process helps coordinate how the region addresses transportation needs with the
end goal of fostering an efficient, convenient, safe, secure, and sustainable
transportation system.

While recognizing the challenges that the
Champaign-Urbana MPA faces, LRTP: Sustainable Choices 2040 looks into the future
and describes a vision for Champaign-Urbana’s transportation system. The plan
anticipates future conditions and outlines issues that should be considered when
confronting those conditions. Most importantly, the plan identifies broad policy
goals and objectives associated with strategic actions and performance measures
to improve accessibility, mobility, and regional connectivity in ways that
support sustainability and economic growth.

The Champaign County Regional
Planning Commission (CCRPC) is the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for
the Champaign- Urbana urbanized area. Within the CCRPC, the Champaign-Urbana
Urbanized Area Transportation Study (CUUATS) has been designated the
transportation planning entity. CUUATS staff is responsible for updating the
LRTP, as well as other federally-mandated transportation planning documents. The
member agencies of CUUATS are the City of Champaign, the City of Urbana, the
Village of Savoy, the University of Illinois, Champaign County, the Champaign
Urbana Mass Transit District (CUMTD), the Illinois Department of Transportation
(IDOT), and CCRPC.

All CUUATS member agencies set forth approaches in this
document to achieve accessibility, mobility, and regional connectivity
improvement goals that pavement alone cannot provide, particularly in terms of
enhancing the quality of life of Champaign-Urbana’s residents. As a community
transportation policy document, Sustainable Choices 2040 sets the direction for
future investments and enhances the findings of Choices 2035, Champaign-Urbana’s
previous LRTP, by using improved modeling tools and a dramatically expanded
public involvement campaign to more clearly define the region’s transportation
issues and identify a future vision along with strategies to realize it.

## Champaign-Urbana MPO and LRTP Performance measures
The federal transportation legislation, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st
Century (MAP-21), requires MPOs to develop a performance-based approach to
transportation decision-making to support the seven national goals of the
federal aid highway program (see bottom right corner).

MAP-21 requires that each MPO establishes performance measures and targets that
track progress toward attainment of critical outcomes for its region. This
performance-based planning approach reflects best practices for transportation
planning and programming and can enhance an MPO’s effectiveness in many ways. In
addition, since 2004, the Champaign-Urbana MPO has been tracking data-driven
performance measures to monitor progress towards the attainment of specific
goals and objectives related to transportation, land use development, safety,
multi-modalism, accessibility, connectivity, air quality, and other planning
factors delineated in previous LRTP documents. An annual report card has been
prepared every year for the last four years to show the results of performance
measure progress.

Performance measures are intended for use by MPOs at both broad and focused
levels. In general, performance measures can answer questions about whether the
performance of components of the transportation system are getting better or
worse over time and whether the stated goals of specific transportation
investments are being achieved (Boston Region MPO, The Development of
Performance Measures and Performance- Based Planning Memorandum).

As part of the LRTP: Sustainable Choices 2040, CUUATS staff will identify new
performance measures and associated targets to reflect the vision and goals
identified in the plan. Monitoring performance measures is an ongoing task for
CUUATS staff and Sustainable Choices 2040 is shaped, in part, by progress
achieved toward the goals set in the last two LRTPs.

## Moving Ahead for Progress In The 21st Century
The federal surface transportation authorization legislation, MAP-21, was
enacted on July 6, 2012 and took effect on October 1, 2012. MAP-21 requirements
for the LRTP are very similar to the previous transportation authorization,
SAFETEA-LU, including addressing eight planning factors, analyzing future
conditions of the transportation system, analyzing air quality, and developing a
fiscally constrained financial plan. Promoting the MAP-21 planning factors
(below) is a primary goal for the LRTP.

* Support the economic vitality of the metropolitan area, especially by enabling
* global competitiveness, productivity, and efficiency. Increase the safety of
* the transportation system for motorized and non-motorized users. Increase the
* security of the transportation system for motorized and non-motorized users.
* Increase accessibility and mobility of people and freight. Protect and enhance
* the environment, promote energy conservation, improve the quality of life, and
* promote consistency between transportation improvements and State and local
* planned growth and economic development patterns. Enhance the integration and
* connectivity of the transportation system, across and between modes, for
* people and freight. Promote efficient system management and operation.
* Emphasize the preservation of the existing transportation system.

## State of Illinois Transportation Plan
The Illinois State Transportation Plan Transforming Transportation for Tomorrow
was adopted in December 2012. The plan represents IDOT’s commitment to a safe,
sustainable, integrated multimodal transportation system. The plan’s policies
and goals provide a framework to guide the sustainable development of a single,
integrated transportation system; a quality transportation system that is safe,
efficient, and reliable; and one that also enhances quality of life and supports
the economic prosperity of all its citizens. In addition, the plan outlines
investment priorities for the future and will have a significant impact on which
projects receive funding accross the state.

The plan was based on technical analysis, public outreach, and an overarching
goal to “develop a safe, sustainable Illinois multimodal transportation system.”
The plan’s eight guiding policy factors include:

* Safety for all transportation users. Preserving and managing the existing
* infrastructure. Accommodating future growth in population and employment.
* Support of global economic competitiveness. Transportation for underserved
* populations such as the elderly, lowincome, and persons with disabilities.
* Protecting the environment. Securing adequate funding for maintaining,
* improving, and ensuring efficient operation of the transportation systems.
* Security to protect the State’s valuable assets and ensure the continued
* operation of the system.

## Integrating Federal, State, and Local Priorities Into The LRTP
The performance-based investment decisions and targets required by MAP-21 should
be coordinated with those of relevant national, state, and local agencies,
including IDOT and public transportation providers, to ensure consistency.
Therefore, the vision, goals, objectives, and performance measures being
developed for the LRTP: Sustainable Choices 2040 are a result of considering the
seven national goals, IDOT’s eight major guiding policy factors, professional
planning paradigms, various local planning studies, and input received from the
public. In addition to the documented goals and strategies of planning agencies
and other relevant institutions, Sustainable Choices is being developed in the
context of the existing social, financial, and political environment, through
which local planning officials and other decision-makers must constantly
navigate in a way that respects and supports the overarching framework of
democratic governance while striving to fulfill the best interests of the local
community that the plan is based on. Some current challenges facing the
Champaign-Urbana area, the metropolitan planning process, the state, and the
nation include:

* Pressures from continued population and employment growth and concurrent
* demands on infrastructure capacity and maintenance; Community expectations for
* economic development which are integrally tied to transportation improvements
* and maintenance; Fulfilling important investment commitments in the context of
* fiscal strain at all levels of government; Unresolved transportation funding
* challenges within national, state, and local political environments.

## A Sustainable Vision for Choices in 2040
The LRTP: Sustainable Choices 2040 has an overall mission to offer
sustainable transportation choices within the region that will help balance
the economic, environmental, and social aspects of urban growth and
development. This overall mission has been developed around six major
themes, which are the result of extensive research and data collection
(Chapters 2-7) and an ambitious and innovative public outreach
campaign (Appendix A). We are relying on the definition of sustainability
set forth by the Report of the World Commission on Environment and
Development produced by the United Nations in 1987:

*Sustainability is defined as balancing the economic, environmental,
and social aspects of urban growth and development to meet the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs.*

This includes understanding the use and maintenance of the regional
transportation system as well as its relationship with issues such as
fluctuating energy costs, climate change, environmental preservation,
and public health. This overarching vision of sustainability is supported in
the transportation realm by planning goals that federal, state, and local
area transportation and land use plans share.
