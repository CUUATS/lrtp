This section offers a brief review of the history of the long-range
transportation planning process in the Champaign-Urbana urbanized area over the
last 50 years. The review is an important part of the current planning process
because it establishes the historical development of the urbanized area with
respect to the transportation system. The previous plans provide a long-range
transportation planning guide to aid local officials in making planning and
policy decisions while meeting the Federal Highway Administration’s requirements
to plan regionally for the Federal-Aid Highway Program.

The growth of the Champaign-Urbana region from its founding in 1833 in Urbana to
the middle of the 20th century has included increases in population (Figure 2.1)
and physical developments (Figure 2.2). Growth in the region has radiated out
from the original center in downtown Urbana and the railroad in downtown
Champaign due to growth of the railroad industry and increases in enrollment at
the University of Illinois. The University of Illinois is shown in a different
color in Figure 2.2 since its growth happened in parallel with that of Champaign
and Urbana. Much of the land area of the University was established in the
1800s, although growth to the north, south and west took place in the 1900s.

The transportation system in the Champaign-Urbana urbanized area has grown over
time to keep up with population, employment, and housing growth in the cities
and the University of Illinois (Figure 2.3). Generally, growth of the urbanized
area after the middle of the 20th century has expanded out from the Cities of
Champaign and Urbana to encompass more of the outlying villages and agricultural
land. The nature of the transportation system has changed over time to meet new
transportation needs including the establishment of the railroads beginning in
the mid 1800s and the construction of the highways in the 1960s and 1970s.

## Inter-Urban Rail
Historically there has been a succession of local inter-urban rail services
between Urbana and neighboring communities. In 1855 a horse-drawn “omnibus”
connected travelers between the county seat of Urbana and the Illinois Central
Railroad depot in Champaign. In 1863, the Urbana Railroad Company operated a
mule-powered trolley drawn on a rail line between these points. This line was
electrified in 1891, and within a few years the route expanded to include
service between Urbana, the University of Illinois campus, the Illinois Central
depot, Champaign County Fairgrounds, and Eisner Park.

In 1902 William B. McKinley established the first electric inter-urban railway
connecting Urbana, Champaign, and Danville. Within a decade this was extended
beyond Springfield to St. Louis, Missouri. This line was discontinued in the
1950s.

## Pre-1960 Roadway Planning
By 1960, two major street and highway plans had been completed for
Champaign-Urbana. Civic design classes at the University of Illinois prepared
the first regional plan, and Swanson Associates, which proposed an efficient
transportation network to improve street network irregularities, completed the
first comprehensive plan.

## Previous Long Range Transportation Planning
### 1960-1970 LRTPs
In 1960, Harland Bartholomew and Associates prepared “A Major Street and Highway
Plan for the Champaign-Urbana Urban Area” for the State of Illinois Division of
Highways. During the 1960s, Champaign-Urbana experienced rapid urban growth,
creating an immediate need for the Long Range Transportation Planning process.
In addition to this trend, the Federal- Aid Highway Act of 1962 established the
Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area Transportation Study as a regional planning
agency in 1964.

To accommodate the transportation needs of the projected population for the next
20 years, Harland Bartholomew and Associates prepared the first comprehensive
transportation plan for CUUATS in 1968-1970. The population of Champaign-Urbana
was projected to be 94,236 in 1965 and 137,200 in 1985.

The plan was written to guide and provide for well-coordinated, adequate, and
economical transportation solutions considering future expansion and
compatibility with the overall comprehensive plan. Complementing its focus on
transportation, the plan designated a major thoroughfare system to connect the
new and the existing developed areas.

### 1974 MPO Creation
In 1974, the State of Illinois designated the Champaign County Regional Planning
Commission (CCRPC) as the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the area
to encourage regional planning efforts.

### 1979,1982, and 1986 LRTP Updates
Apart from planning for a safe, efficient and economical transportation system,
the 1979 plan update aimed to organize land uses in a balanced, functional and
mutually compatible manner. This plan focused on guiding growth and expansion in
harmony with the natural environment. It aimed to accommodate a system that
would safely and conveniently encompass a variety of transportation modes and
thus enhance the overall quality of life. The plan also included a variety of
factors affecting the transportation system in the area, including land use, the
development of mass transit plan, vehicle registration, a bikeway plan to
accommodate increased biking activity, and transportation funding resources.

Subsequent LRTP updates built on the content developed in the 1979 update. The
1984 update included a list of transportation improvements across the
Champaign-Urbana metropolitan planning area. In addition, projects were
classified as long-range or short-range and prioritized by level of urgency. The
1986 LRTP update also involved a critical assessment of previous and ongoing
transportation proposals.

### 1994 LRTP + Mobility Plan: C-U in 2020
In 1994, CUUATS staff produced a new Long Range Transportation Plan in
combination with a Mobility Plan for a 25-year planning horizon. At that time,
the MPO included the City of Champaign, the City of Urbana, and the Village of
Savoy.

### 1999 LRTP: C-U in 2030
In 1999, CUUATS published the LRTP: C-U in 2030, which covered a 30-year period
and aimed to plan for the future needs of an estimated population of 203,847 by
the year 2030.

At that time, the mass transit system’s primary service was a fixed route and
scheduled system with principal transfer locations in downtown Champaign
(Illinois Terminal), downtown Urbana (Lincoln Square) and the University of
Illinois (Illini Union). The plan called for additional investment in rail and
suggested investigating the feasibility of establishing a high-speed rail
corridor along the Chicago-Champaign-Carbondale- Memphis line. The plan also
recommended studying ways to increase air travel at Willard Airport.

### 2004 LRTP: 2025
CUUATS published the LRTP 2025 in 2004, which included portions of Bondville in
the study area for the first time and established the use of performance
measures to track progress toward goals and objectives over time.

### 2009 LRTP: Choices 2035
The LRTP, Choices 2035, was published in 2009 and futher developed the process
of utilizing performance goals in long-range transportation planning by using
annual report cards to help evaluate ongoing performance and guide future
decision-making for the region.
