Land use and planning principles are critical to understanding the impact of
future transportation investments. The coordination of land use and
transportation development requires the assessment and evaluation of how land
use decisions both affect the transportation system and increase viable options
for people to access opportunities, goods, services, and other resources to
improve their quality of life. This requires an awareness of the effects that
existing and future transportation conditions may have on land use development
demand, choices, and patterns. Measuring land use density over time can indicate
the ways in which different municipalities grow, but measuring density alone
does not provide a complete picture of the ways in which different
municipalities grow and plan for future development. Due to municipal
annexations for the purposes of planning and future development, even
municipalities with intentions of efficient, compact development could have vast
undeveloped acreages within their corporate limits that make density measures
appear incongruous with current development practices or future development
goals. Population density and residential are both documented in this chapter in
order to capture a more accurate picture of how each municipality is developing.
For a more in-depth picture of local growth practices and policies, see planning
documents specific to each municipality. Effective coordination of land use and
transportation planning and development can produce policies, principles, and
strategies intended to preserve and enhance valued natural and cultural
resources and facilitate healthy, sustainable communities and neighborhoods.
This type of coordination can also foster an efficient balance of mixed uses,
such as housing, education, employment, recreation, retail, and service
opportunities, to maximize the benefits of geographic proximity.
