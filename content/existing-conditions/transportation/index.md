This section of the LRTP: Sustainable Choices 2040 will detail infrastructure,
safety, and mode use for the following modes of transportation within the
urbanized and metro planning areas:

* Pedestrians and persons with disabilities
* Bicycles
* Bus transit
* Motor vehicles
* Rail and freight
* Airplanes

Understanding how the transportation system currently works with regard to the
quantity of the infrastructure and frequency of use, planners can better assess
how the system should evolve into the future. Furthermore, providing active
transportation options and multimodal access to different parts of the region is
paramount to developing healthy neighborhoods and improving population health.

The data in this section of the LRTP were collected by the Champaign County
Regional Planning Commission (CCRPC), Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area
Transportation Study (CUUATS), CUUATS member agencies, the Illinois Department
of Transportation and U.S. Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Census
Bureau.

The following sections will provide detailed information on the existing
conditions for each transportation mode within the transportation system, as
well as relevant information regarding infrastructure, safety, ridership, mode
share, and security where data are available.

The transportation system of the Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area includes
these major infrastructure elements:

* Miles of Sidewalks 817.9
* Accessible Pedestrian Signals 31
* Miles of Bicycle Infrastructure 86.27
* Traffic Signals 163
* CUMTD Buses 102 buses (55 hybrids)
* CUMTD Routes 52
* CUMTD Bus Stops 2,500
* Miles of Roadway 1,013
* Rail Passenger Routes 3
* Rail Freight Carriers 3
* Commercial Airports 1
* Private Airports 1

## Pedestrians and Persons with Disabilities
People have a greater tendency to travel by walking when a route is safe,
convenient, accessible, and a relatively short distance. When people choose to
travel without a car, they not only improve their health, but they also create
less noise, pollution, and traffic than a car and gain the opportunity to enjoy
their surroundings at a slower pace. Approximately seven percent of the workers
in the urbanized area walk to work each day, in addition to many children,
seniors and college students who walk to school and perform errands by walking
each day.

There are 797 miles of sidewalks in the urbanized area, and 8181 miles in the
metropolitan planning area (Figure 7.1). Since there is not a complete inventory
of sidewalk infrastructure at this time, this plan only assesses and documents
the sidewalk network in the urbanized area to better understand issues of
mobility, accessibility, and connectivity.

### Pedestrian Safety
{{<image src="intersection.jpg"
alt="a bike and automobiles wait at a stop light in an urban area"
caption="APS on the SE corner of Race Street and Main Street in Urbana, 2014"
position="right">}}
Accessible pedestrian signals provide an audible or other non-visual cue about
the WALK and DON’T WALK intervals at signalized intersections to visually
impaired pedestrians. Overall, there are 31 accessible pedestrian signals in the
urbanized area, which is 19 percent of the 163 total traffic signals in the
region. Table 7.2 shows that the urbanized area has increased the total number
of accessible pedestrian signals by 82 percent since 2009. A continued increase
in accessible pedestrian signals over time helps ensure the safety of all
pedestrians in crosswalks across the urbanized area.

Pedestrians and people with disabilities are generally the most vulnerable road
users because of their lack of protection and relatively slow speed when
compared to other modes of travel. In 2011, 4,432 pedestrians were killed in the
United States in traffic crashes, and national statistics show that 19.4 percent
of pedestrian deaths in 2011 occurred at intersections according to the 2013
Fatality Analysis Reporting System.

Figure 7.2 displays the age distribution of pedestrians involved in traffic
crashes between 2007 and 2011. The chart shows that 52.5 percent of pedestrians
involved in traffic crashes during the study period were under the age of 25.
Targeting this age group may be one strategy to support efforts to decrease
motor vehicle crashes with pedestrians.

Figure 7.4 shows pedestrian crash frequency by intersection in Champaign and
Urbana. As the figure illustrates, a high frequency of pedestrian crashes are
concentrated in the University of Illinois District, which is in accordance with
the high percentage of college-age students being involved in crashes, as
demostrated in Figure 7.2. Pedestrian safety is a recurring issue for the region
because of the constantly changing population on the University of Illinois
campus. Education and enforcement activities should be continually supported in
the region, particularly on campus, to enhance the safety of all road users.

Table 7.3 illustrates pedestrian crashes with motor vehicles in Champaign-
Urbana reported over a five-year period between 2007 and 2011. The IDOT
categories for crashes and injuries used in the charts are defined in Figure
7.3. It can be seen on Table 7.3 that total pedestrian injuries have increased
since 2009, though the number of fatalities has remained about the same. The
number of crashes in each injury severity category has also increased since
2009, except for the least severe injuries.

## Public Input - Pedestrians
The comments that referenced the pedestrian system (including walking,
wheelchairs, or motorized chairs) focused mostly on sidewalks and safety.
Respondents made a point to comment on sidewalks, paths, and points of
accessibility they appreciated and described as “functioning well,” but also
pointed out many locations where sidewalks were non-existent, not accessible,
and/or poorly lit. This was the transportation mode with the highest percentage
of comments described as “dangerous.” As such, respondents were most concerned
about protection from cars while walking in certain neighborhoods where there
are no sidewalks or sidewalks in poor conditions that can force pedestrians and
people in wheelchairs to use the street. In terms of the overall transportation
system, pedestrians are more vulnerable than bikers, cars, or buses because they
are slower and relatively unprotected in the event of a collision. Comments from
people with disabilities indicate that lack of American Disabilities Act (ADA)
compliance is an issue on public sidewalks, as well as in and around public and
commercial buildings in the region.

Figure 7.5 shows the pedestrian comments that were able to be mapped. The
majority of comments labelled as “functioning well” are concentrated in the core
of the urbanized area, where respondents indicated an appreciation for walking
in locations where there are other pedestrians and activities as well as
multimodal connectivity to various destinations.

## Bicycles
Bicycles are faster than walking, require less money and space to operate than a
car, and can improve physical health and wellness. People will choose to bike if
infrastructure like well-designed bike lanes or wide shoulders are in place to
ensure that their trips are safe and convenient. Biking is an important
alternative to commuting by car and can help connect people to other
transportation modes like transit routes. According to the 2010 American
Community Survey, approximately two percent of the workers in the urbanized area
ride a bicycle to work, not including people who use a bicycle to get to school
or run errands.

To accommodate bicyclists, 86 miles of bicycle facilities have been constructed
in the metropolitan planning area (MPA). These facilities include shared-use
paths (side paths and off-street paths), bike paths, onstreet bike lanes, and
shared-lane markings also known as “sharrows.” The existing regional bicycle
facilities have been catalogued and assessed in the Champaign County Greenways &
Trails Plan Update 2013. As is shown in Table 7.4, a 44 percent increase in the
mileage of bicycle facilities in the MPA took place between 2009 and 2012, with
an increase in total mileage each year since 2009. Capitalizing on this trend
through further expansion of both bicycle and trail facilities, especially near
afforable housing, will support the creation of healthier neighborhoods and
regional connections for active transportation users within the urbanized area.

Figure 7.6 shows the geographic distribution of bicycle facilities in the MPA.
As the map illustrates, the majority of the bicycle facilities are located in
Champaign, Urbana and Savoy. Mahomet also has bike infrastructure that, if
extended east, could play a key role in connecting Champaign to Mahomet in the
future.

According to the Greenways & Trails Plan Update, access to pedestrian and
bicycle facilities in the MPA is highest in Urbana, followed by Champaign and
Savoy. Table 7.5 shows the accessibility for walkable/bikeable and bikeable
households for the region. A quarter of a mile is considered walkable/bikeable
and a half of a mile is considered bikeable.

### Bicycle Safety
Bicyclists are vulnerable road users whose collisions with motor vehicles often
result in serious injury or even death. In 2010, 618 bicyclists were killed and
an additional 52,000 bicyclists were injured in motor vehicle crashes
nationwide. National statistics show that nearly 31 percent of bicycle
fatalities in 2011 occurred at intersections. Table 7.6 shows the total number
of crashes, fatalities, and injuries due to bicycle-vehicle crashes for
Champaign-Urbana between 2007 and 2011. Injury severity is described as A, B,
and C, which represent the most severe, moderately severe, and least severe
injuries, respectively. Total crashes and injuries have decreased over the study
period, although the number of fatalities has remained constant. The number of A
injuries, the most severe, have increased since 2007, although B and C injuries
have decreased. Figure 7.7 and Figure 7.8 highlight the propensity of university
students to be involved in bicycle crashes: Figure 7.7 shows bicycle crashes by
age and Figure 7.8 shows the frequency of bicycle crashed by intersection.

{{<table url="table7-6.csv"
title="Bicycle Crashes in Champaign-Urbana (2007-2011)"
source="Illinois Department of Transportation">}}

## Public Input : Bicycles
Like pedestrians, bikers are much more vulnerable than cars or buses in the
event of a collision. The largest portion of comments regarding the bicycle
network, about 40 percent, are in reference to locations that “need improvement”
in terms of making biking safer from car traffic by adding more bike lines
and/or improving the connectivity of existing bike lanes and paths. A common
complaint among cyclists and motorists alike was that it can be difficult to
share the road, especially when bikers or drivers don’t follow the same rules of
the road. Bicycling is the only transportation mode that is consistently used by
an average of 15 percent of all respondents in every age group (Figure 7.9).
Figure 7.10 shows the bike comments that were able to be mapped.
{{<image src="intersection.jpg"
alt="a bike and automobiles wait at a stop light in an urban area"
caption="Race Street and Main Street, Urbana, 2014"
position="center">}}
## Transit
Buses are an excellent and inexpensive option for traveling around the
Champaign-Urbana community and across the region. Buses are able to accommodate
more people than automobiles with fewer resources, and as more people use this
type of transportation, traffic may decrease for other transportation modes.
Buses also connect pedestrians, persons with disabilities, and bicyclists to
long-distance destinations around town.

### Bus Transit
The Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (C-U MTD) is the public
transportation agency that services the urbanized area (Figure 7.11). In
addition to being affordable and convenient, the C-U MTD provides mobility for
the many people who cannot drive or choose not to drive, including the eight
percent of Champaign-Urbana’s households that do not have access to a car.

C-U MTD currently operates 52 routes with more than 2,500 fixedstops, including
683 with signs and 88 with shelters. C-U MTD also operates deviated fixed-routes
and demand-response services that pick up passengers by reservation at
designated locations within a specified service area. SafeRides is a night van
service covering parts of the University of Illinois campus upon request. C-U
MTD also operates ADA paratransit service in compliance with the Americans with
Disabilities Act. As of 2013, the price for a regular, annual bus pass is $72,
down from $235 in 2008. A one-way ride with a free transfer is $1, while DASH
passes for senior citizens and persons with disabilities remain free, as do
rides for children under 46 inches in height. All eligible University of
Illinois students, faculty, and staff have unlimited access to C-U MTD service
with their valid University-issued ID card. University students pay a mandatory
fee each semester for this unlimited access.

In February 2007, C-U MTD switched to a more accurate, computerbased counting
system located in each bus to track ridership. For the purposes of consistency
and accuracy, this report will use ridership data starting in February 2007. The
recent rise in gas prices; the reduction in the annual pass price; expanded
routes and service; efforts to promote biking, walking and transit; and an
overall change in the perception of public transportation have collectively led
to higher ridership numbers for C-U MTD from 2008 to the present. Comparing 2007
to 2012, there has been an increase of 2.4 million rides per year (Figure 7.10).

Approximately 4.9 percent of workers over the age of 16 take public
transportation to work each day across the United States. In comparison, in
Champaign and Urbana, nearly 9.5 percent of workers in the same age range take
the bus to work each day. In contrast, the entire MPA has a lower rate of 4.7
percent of workers who use transit to commute to work, due to the fact that the
villages of Bondville, Mahomet, and Tolono are outside the C-U MTD service area.
In order to increase mobility and the use of buses for commuters in the ubanized
area, the C-U MTD service area should be expanded to be coterminous with the
urbanized area as much as possible.

Along with analyzing ridership, CUUATS staff assessed the acreage of residential
parcels within 1/4 mile of C-U MTD weekday bus stops to understand how
comprehensive the transit coverage is within C-U MTD’s current service area.
Staff analyzed coverage within the transit service area boundary because the
boundary is constantly updated as new annexations are brought into the C-U MTD
service area, making it easier to track coverage over time.

C-U MTD covered 97.4 percent of the total residential areas in its service area
in 2012. Figure 7.12 shows the geographic distribution of the residences with
and without service in the service area. Table 7.7 shows the percentage of
single-family and multi-family residential areas within 1/4 mile of a weekday
transit route. The table indicates that coverage for single-family residential
land uses has increased more than 10 percent and coverage for multi-family
residential land uses has increased almost 5 percent since 2009. The C-U MTD
service area has an overall average coverage of just over 98 percent of all
residential land uses in 2012.

{{<table url="table7-7.csv"
title="C-U MTD Coverage of Residences in the Servce Area by Type (2009 & 2012)"
source="CUUATS">}}

In 2013, 55 percent of C-U MTD’s fleet was hybrid diesel-electric, up from 9
percent in 2009. These vehicles consume 25 percent less fuel than diesel-only
vehicles and help reduce noise pollution1. The use of hybrid buses not only
improves fuel efficiency, but helps with the reduction of greenhouse gases in
the urbanized area. Table 7.8 shows the growth of C-U MTD’s hybrid bus fleet
between 2009 and 2013.

### Human Services Transportation
Human services transportation providers help meet the transportation needs of
the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and persons and families with low
income(s). Often, these individuals and families have four types of limitations
that preclude them from driving:

* Physical: old age, blindness, paralysis, developmental disabilities,
acute illness, etc.
* Financial: Unable to purchase or rent a personal vehicle
* Legal: Too young, loss of driver’s license, or driver’s license not
obtained
* Self-imposed: Choose not to own or drive a vehicle

In order to meet the needs of these populations, general public, human services,
student, and private transportation services are available. Transportation
providers are detailed in Table 7.9.

{{<table url="table7-9.csv"
title="Urbanized Area Human Services Transportation Providers"
source="CUUATS">}}

Despite the numerous human services transportation providers in the region, many
opportunities exist to improve how the urbanized area transportation system
functions. In terms of accessibility, there are issues concerning ease of use,
underserved and unserved areas, and a lack of centralized information. In terms
of availability, issues of scheduling and temporal limitations are present. The
reliability of the system is also an issue because of the frequency of service,
in addition to restrictions that result from program eligibility requirements
and trip purposes. More detailed information can be found in the C-U Urbanized
Area Human Services Transportation Plan.

### Intercity Bus System
{{<image src="ccarts.jpg"
alt="the front of a rural transit bus"
caption="C-CARTS Transit Vehicle, 2014"
position="right">}}
A variety of intercity transportation options are available in the urbanized
area, ranging from charter service to weekend service for University of Illinois
students. Outgoing schedules are provided for those services that have Champaign
as a point of origin. Buses provide more opportunities for intercity travel
compared to air and passenger rail (Table 7.10 and Table 7.11). Between 2009 and
2012, bus service for 16 in-state and 9 out-of-state destinations was lost due
to the closure of a bus transport company.

## Public Input: Transit

position="right">}}
Of the comments received regarding transit in the community, only five percent
refer to the network as “dangerous.” There were just as many comments that
referred to the system as “functions well” as there were comments referring to
areas that “need improvement,” whereas the “needs improvement” category
outweighed the “functions well” category in all other modes. In general,
respondents appreciate the transit system and the accessibility it offers to
different populations and different regions in the urbanized area. Many
suggestions for improvement include wanting more bus service: adding additional
routes or stops at new locations and extending service hours. In addition,
several respondents requested more direct routes to locations as a way to reduce
travel times, citing long travel times as the main reason for not riding the bus
more often. Other suggestions include improving accessibility and safety when
boarding at certain locations. Figure 7.13 shows the transit system comments
that were able to be mapped.

## Automobiles
Automobiles are convenient for allowing people to travel freely and connect them
to long-distance destinations within and outside the community. However, high
purchase, maintenance, and fuel costs can make owning and operating an
automobile more expensive than other options, underscoring the potential for
multimodal transportation choices (i.e. carsharing, public transit, bicycling,
walking) to reduce transportation costs and increase household spending power.
Moreover, automobile conditions like traffic congestion, pollution, and noise
are not accounted for by individual drivers, but are experienced by all people
within the community. According to the 2010 American Community Survey,
approximately 72 percent of the workers in the urbanized area drive to work
alone each day and nearly 11 percent carpool. This does not include the tens of
thousands who drive to school or to run errands each day in the urbanized area
as well. Road infrastructure is well-established for automobiles, but requires
regular maintenance to maintain a high level of service.

### Annual Vehicle Registrations
The number of vehicles registered in Champaign County provides a rough estimate
of the number of drivers in the area1 (Table 7.12). These motor vehicles are a
large part of the transportation system and use the roadways in the region each
day. Motor vehicles include passenger cars and trucks, motorcycles, B trucks*,
and other** vehicles, including TA trailers, fiscal trucks, recreational
vehicles, and more. The total number of registered vehicles in the County has
fallen by almost 10,000 between 2010 and 2012 with most of the decrease
happening in the All Other category.

{{<table url="table7-12.csv"
title="Champaign County Annual Vehicle Registrations (2009-2012)"
notes="B truck: weight = 8,000 pounds or less All Other: TA Trailer, weight =3,000 lbs or lesss; Fiscal truck, weight = more than 8,000 lbs, and “other” category from Illinois Vehicle Registration records."
source="http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/departments/vehicles/statistics/home.html">}}

Figure 7.14 shows the functional classification of the roadways in the
Metropolitan Planning Area (MPA) and urbanized area. IDOT classifies the
roadways throughout the state to help describe levels of mobility and
accessibility within each category.

* Interstates have the highest level of mobility and the lowest level of
accessibility. Interstates and other principal arterials serve trips through
urban areas and long-distance trips between urban areas.
* Minor arterials serve shorter trips between traffic generators within
urban areas; they have more access but a lower level of mobility than
interstates and other principal arterials.
* Collectors provide both mobility and access by gathering trips from
localized areas and feeding them onto the arterial network.
* Local streets are lower-volume roadways that provide direct land
access but are not designed to serve through-traffic.

Figure 7.15 shows the distribution of functional classification categories in
the MPA. The majority of traffic movement occurs on the interstates and other
principal arterials, which have higher speed limits due to less accessibility
and conflict points with cross streets and driveways. Currently, there are
approximately 1,013 miles of roadways in the MPA and 630 miles of roadways in
the urbanized area including parts of Champaign, Urbana, Savoy, Tolono and
Bondville.

### Roadways Average Daily Traffic
IDOT provides average daily traffic data for interstates and selected major
arterials and collectors in the MPA. Figure 7.16 shows the 2011 average daily
traffic (ADT) ranges for the selected roadways in the metro area. The
interstates have the highest ADT followed by major arterials like Prospect
Avenue, Neil Street, University Avenue, Mattis Avenue, and Cunningham Avenue.
Smaller segments of Springfield Avenue and Bradley Avenue also have relatively
high ADT volumes. The five busiest roadways in the MPA are Prospect Avenue,
Mattis Avenue, Cunningham Avenue, Neil Street, and University Avenue. These
roads act as gateways into the urbanized area and see heavy traffic from local
use within the urbanized area.
{{<table url="table7-13.csv"
title="VMT and Total Crash Rate in Champaign-Urbana"
source="Illinois Department of Transportation">}}

### VMT and Total Crash Rate in Champaign-Urbana
The number of crashes in the urbanized area per the total vehicle miles traveled
(VMT) is an important index for crash analysis. The VMT1 reflects the total
number of vehicle miles traveled in the region and the number of crashes
provides information about crashes that took place between automobiles and other
modes of transportation.
{{<image src="downtown.jpg"
alt="automobiles use a one-way road in an urban area"
caption="Downtown Champaign, 2012"
position="right">}}
The VMT data were obtained from the IDOT’s annually published Illinois Travel
Statistics. Table 7.13 shows the VMT information for the Champaign-Urbana area.
Table 7.13 and Figure 7.17 show that the number of crashes per 100 million VMT
in Champaign-Urbana has been decreasing since 2008 and is consistently lower
than the statewide rates.


### Traffic Crash Fatalities
Figure 7.18 shows fatalities per 100 million VMT from 2007 to 2011 in Champaign
and Urbana, the corresponding values for the State of Illinois, and the
statewide goal for fatalities per million VMT proposed by IDOT’s Division of
Traffic Safety in the Highway Safety Performance Plan (HSPP) each year. The HSPP
for FY 2011 established a goal of reducing the statewide fatality rate (per 100
million VMT) from 0.86 in year 2009 to 0.84 by year 2010 and 0.76 by 2011. The
Champaign- Urbana fatality rate for each study year met the HSPP goal.

Figure 7.19 shows the traffic crash fatalities in Champaign and Urbana from 2007
to 2011. The figure indicates that the total fatalities reached the lowest point
in 2009. In the same year, no fatalities were reported in the City of Champaign.
Though the number of fatalities increased for 2010 and 2011, the number of
fatalities in those years were lower than 2007 and 2008. Figure 7.20 identifies
the fatal automobile crash locations in the area from 2007-2011.

### Corridor Crash Analysis
Identifying and analyzing crashes along the key corridors in the region helps
improve corridor safety and promote efficient traffic flow. The traffic crashes
along the five major east-west and six north-south corridors in Champaign-Urbana
are summarized in this section. Table 7.14 provides the total number of crashes,
injuries, and fatalities along major corridors. Table 7.15 and Table 7.16 show
the change in the number of severe crashes and fatal crashes on the corridors
over the five-year study period.

Avenue also had the highest number of fatalities during the same period.

Table 7.15 shows that University Avenue, Mattis Avenue, Bradley Avenue, and
Springfield Avenue are the corridors with the highest number of severe crashes
in the Champaign-Urbana area. Table 7.16 shows the number of fatal crashes along
the same major corridors between 2007 and 2011.

Figure 7.21 identifies the location of the fatal and severe crashes along the
major corridors in Champaign-Urbana between 2007 and 2011.

The volume of traffic, crash frequency, crash rate, and crash severity for
intersections help CUUATS staff prioritize intersection improvements across the
region. Based on the critical intersection selection priority levels criteria,
the signalized intersections listed in Table 7.18 were identified as critical in
Champaign-Urbana. As seen in Table 7.18, there were no signalized intersections
in the Priority 1 or Priority 2 lists, though 13 intersections are listed as
Priority level 3.

### Pavement Conditions
The Pavement Condition Index (PCI) assesses whether roads are in excellent,
good, fair, poor, and very poor conditions. According to data received directly
from each public works jurisdiction listed in the tables below, across the
region, pavement conditions have remained relatively stable from 2009 to 2012
(Table 7.19 and Table 7.20).

In the past decade, automobiles that run on something other than gasoline have
become more common. As a result, there are several alternative fueling stations
to accommodate this trend in the Champaign- Urbana Metropolitan Planning Area
(MPA) (Figure 7.22). Alternative fuel infrastructure in the area include, four
liquefied petroleum gas outlets (LPG, commonly known as propane), 13 gas
stations that sell ethanol (E85), and several locations for charging electric
vehicles.

Of all the respondents over 30 years of age, an average of 52 percent rely on a
car to get around the community in a typical week. Many of the “needs
improvement” comments regarding cars involved congestion and parking. The
majority of congestion complaints were in reference to the North Prospect area.
Several comments also refer to locations where drivers would like to see
connectivity to other transportation systems improved as a way to reduce their
reliance on cars and improve safety in sharing the road network with
pedestrians, bicyclists, and buses. Figure 7.23 shows the automobile comments
that were able to be mapped.

## Commercial Trucks
Three interstates and several state and national routes intersect in the
urbanized area. The urbanized area is home to numerous industries and firms that
ship and receive freight at local, regional, and national levels, including 655
trucking units (Table 7.22). The distribution of goods through commercial truck
service is a large part of the local economy.

Currently, there is no local truck route system in place for the urbanized area,
although there is an Illinois State truck route system (Figure 7.24). Illinois
truck routes in the MPA are split into two classes:

* Class one truck routes are on limited-access, divided highways which include
I-74, I-72, and I-57.
* Class two truck routes are on non-interstates with the same weight and size
restrictions, which include portions of Bloomington Road, Chestnut Street,
Cunningham Avenue, Division Street, Dunlap Avenue, High Cross Road, Lombard
Street, Long Street/US 45, Mattis Avenue, Oak Street, Prospect Avenue,
Springfield Avenue, and University Avenue.

Without a local truck route system in place, trucks can travel on any road
between these state truck routes to load or unload, which can increase wear and
tear on roads that were not constructed to handle commercial truck traffic. In
addition, there are no time limits on when trucks can make deliveries in the
urbanized area. Trucks generally deliver during business hours, which can strain
local traffic conditions for other transportation modes. In places that are not
equipped for deliveries by trucks of all sizes, delivery trucks are forced to
block off roads and stop traffic when loading and unloading.

### Commercial Truck ADT
Generally, the heaviest truck traffic, including commercial trucks, occurs on
highways and arterials with less truck traffic on routes in the core of the
urbanized area or local roads (Figure 7.23 and Figure 7.24).

### Trains
Three rail companies own tracks within the CUUATS MPA (Figure 7.27). Canadian
National (CN) operates a north-south line that runs parallel to Neil Street/US
45. CN also operates an east-west line that runs through Champaign west to
Bondville and Seymour; this line connects to the CN north-south line near
downtown Champaign. Norfolk Southern operates a line running roughly parallel to
US Route 150 from west of Champaign through the urbanized area to Smith Road in
Urbana. Union Pacific operates an east-west line through the Village of Tolono.

This region also enjoys a passenger rail route that extends north to Chicago and
south to Memphis and New Orleans. This allows residents to travel to other parts
of the country for business and recreation and enables people and businesses
from outside the area to experience the Champaign-Urbana community as well.
Currently, freight trains and passenger trains share the same tracks, which
regularly causes delays on passenger routes, as freight lines have priority.
Passenger and freight rail should be supported in the future to enhance access
to other communities and support the regional economy.

### Passenger Rail
Amtrak passenger rail service uses the Illinois Terminal in downtown Champaign
as its service hub for the urbanized area. Currently, there are three passenger
rail routes that stop in Champaign: the Saluki and the Illini routes run daily
from Chicago to Carbondale, and the City of New Orleans route runs daily between
Chicago and New Orleans. All three routes run through Illinois Terminal once
daily in each direction. Figure 7.26 shows the annual Amtrak ridership from
Illinois Terminal.

Ridership has been increasing since 2002, with a sharp increase from 2006 to
2008 as a result of an additional round trip added during that time between
Chicago and Carbondale. Since 2009, ridership has been steadily increasing with
a significant 20 percent increase between 2010 and 2011.

## Airplanes
Two airports are located within the MPA. Air travel connects this community to
numerous destinations across the country and the world, facilitating national
and international social, political, and economic relationships. Air
transportation should be supported by integrating it with other modes of
transportation within the community. Planning for a safe and reliable network
that coordinates different transportation modes to support all travel, from
trips next door to trips overseas, will help increase mobility in the region.

Frasca Field is a pivate airport open for public use located one mile north of
the City of Urbana. The University of Illinois Willard Airport is a public
airport providing direct daily flights to Chicago and Dallas/Fort Worth. The
number of arriving and departing flights during different days of the week are
shown in Table 7.23. Willard Airport currently has only one carrier, American
Airlines, after losing Delta Air Lines in 2010. Since then, there are fewer
flights arriving and departing at Willard, and the airport services fewer hubs.

When compared to similar airports in the region, Willard airport traffic is most
comparable to the Springfield Lincoln Capital Airport in the number of
enplanements per year. Table 7.24 shows the comparison of enplanements between
four regional airports in Illinois, including Willard. Willard has lost
thousands of annual enplanements since 2000. Other regional airports in Peoria
and Springfield have experienced a similar trend, though three out of the four
regional airports listed experienced a small increase in flights between 2011
and 2012.

{{<table url="table7-23.csv"
title="Willard Airport Departures and Arrivals (2012)"

{{<table url="table7-24.csv"
title="Regional Airport Enplanements (2012)"
source="Willard Airport Homepage, http://www.flycmi.com/">}}

Table 7.25 and Figure 7.28 show the annual number of flights compared with the
number of enplanements for Willard Airport from 2006-2012. While the number of
enplanements has decreased by 27 percent from 114,768 to 83,796 between 2006 and
2012, the number of flights has decreased by 43 percent from 3,965 to 2,253.

Willard Airport has seen improvements in flight performance and reliability over
time. Between 2003 and 2012, the number of on-time flights has increased a total
of 18 percentage points (Figure 7.29).

Table 7.26 shows the reason for flight delays in 2012. The table illustrates
that aircraft arrival delay, air carrier delay, and aviation systems are the
major contributers to flight delays at Willard Airport, although adverse weather
plays a role as well.

## Public Input: Trains and Airplanes
{{<image src="station.jpg"
alt="a train waits at a station"

Only four percent of all the comments received are in reference to train or
plane travel. Over 25 percent of train comments were in reference to wanting a
high speed, or bullet, rail line in the area. Despite a few suggestions for
Amtrak improvements, respondents enjoy and rely on direct access to Chicago. Of
the plane comments, respondents expressed a desire for more flights out of
Willard to bigger hubs and cheaper parking at the airport. Very few train or
plane comments described either local network as “dangerous.” Figure 7.30 shows
the train and plane comments that were able to be mapped.

## Transportation Security
Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) recognizes security as an
important factor to consider while planning for transportation at the regional
level. Security can be defined as the protection of persons or property from
intentional damage or destruction caused by vandalism, criminal activity, or
terrorist events1. This section addresses transportation security in the
Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Planning Area (MPA).

### Critical Infrastructure
Figure 7.31 shows the location of critical infrastructure in the Champaign-
Urbana urbanized area, including the U.S. Military Strategic Highway Network
(STRAHNET), hospitals and other health facilities, municipal buildings,
airports, highways, railroads, and Illinois Terminal (labeled as an “intermodal
station”).

The Champaign-Urbana Savoy Regional Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
Architecture Plan was adopted by the CUUATS Policy Committee in 2005. ITS are
projects/installations/systems that are intended to maximize the effectiveness,
efficiency, and safety of transportation networks and users through the use of
different technologies in the form of electronic signage on highways, GPS
tracking capabilities in cars, and/ or inductive loop detection on roadways to
keep track of traffic volume and behavior, to name just a few examples. The
process for developing the ITS Architecture Plan included outreach to and
participation by many stakeholders, including surveys and interviews to
establish existing and future infrastructure, services, and projects.
Information about coordination and communication between agencies during
emergency situations was also collected and documented.

Transportation security elements and a framework for the development of a
regional transportation security program were also developed during the planning
process. A list of existing and future services related to transportation
security can be found on the following pages. The current Transportation
Improvement Program (TIP) for the Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Planning
Organization (MPO) includes funds allocated to local ITS projects, such as
changeable message signs and surveillance on Interstate 72, Interstate 74, and
Interstate 57 around Champaign- Urbana. The signs will allow state and local
agencies to communicate important information related to highway conditions to
drivers. The surveillance cameras will allow the Illinois Department of
Transportation to monitor traffic flow and better respond to adverse road
conditions such as snow, ice, flooding, and vehicle crashes.

The ITS Architecture plan assigns roles and responsibilities for each of the
stakeholders, details the functions required, and explains how information flows
between security elements to provide different services. Information flows are
documented as charts in the plan, which provide a quick reference in the event
of an emergency. The ITS Architecture Plan should be updated regularly to
monitor and coordinate changes to the region’s ITS Architecture.

### Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District Security
The importance of additional transit security was recognized after September 11,
2001. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires a transit agency to
certify that at least one percent of the Urbanized Area Formula Grant (UAFG)
program funds it receives annually are used for transit security projects or
that such expenditures are not necessary. As the regional transit agency for the
Champaign-Urbana area, the Champaign Urbana Mass Transit District (C-U MTD)
incorporates a number of security measures to protect the safety and security of
passengers. The following security measures have been implemented by C-U MTD:

* Bus garage Closed Circuit Television (CCTV)
* Administration and Operations facility CCTV
* Illinois Terminal CCTV
* Transit buses Automated Vehicle Location (AVL) system based on GPS technology
* Bus operator activated silent alarms in conjunction with Computer Aided
Dispatch-AVL system and digital audio/video recording system
* Onboard audio and visual next stop announcing system
* Onboard vehicle system sensors providing vehicle conditions
* Real time next bus information displays at key locations
* Voice and data radios for communication between operator and the operations
facility
* Schedule information to passengers through website, System Management Servers
(SMS) and desktop applications

C-U MTD also has transit signal priority (TSP) emitters on the newest buses in
the fleet, though not all the lights in the urbanized area currently have the
TSP equipment to change the lights. The C-U MTD administration and operations
facility, two maintenance facilities, and the Illinois Terminal facility are
equipped with an Employee Prox-Card door security system. Employees are issued a
Prox-Card, which opens specified doors to the facilities. This system is
controlled by C-U MTD security management, which limits access to certain
high-security areas such as the control dispatch center, as well as the
administration and operations facility.

The Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District System Safety Program Plan (2006)
contains procedures and guidelines to regulate and maintain the system to
provide optimum safety considerations for passengers. There also exists an
annually updated C-U MTD Emergency Response and Disaster Plan, which is
coordinated with other state and local emergency response organizations such as
law, fire, public health, Emergency Management System (EMS), and Emergency
Service Disaster Agency (ESDA). The Director of Safety & Training is responsible
for the coordination and update of the plan. Familiarization meetings and
emergency drills with other agencies are conducted regularly to address security
concerns and to practice skills and procedures taught in training. C-U MTD
employees are trained on the standard operating procedures of the security plan.
In addition, transit operators are equipped with two way radios and are trained
in self-defense techniques. Operations supervisors, staff, and Illinois Terminal
security personnel have also been certified in a selfdefense techniques course.

### Champaign County GIS Consortium
The Champaign County GIS Consortium (CCGIS) is a program of Champaign County.
The current members of this consortium are Champaign County, City of Champaign,
City of Urbana, Village of Savoy, Village of Rantoul, Village of Mahomet and the
University of Illinois. Spatial data available with the GIS Consortium can be
used for several securityrelated applications such as emergency vehicle routing,
transit vehicle routing, computer-aided dispatch, and evacuation planning. The
GIS Consortium is working with Champaign County METCAD to implement the GIS
planimetric road centerlines in their new 911 dispatch system. The METCAD system
is a GIS-centric 911 dispatch system. It utilizes the Consortium address points
and street centerlines to locate an address. It then utilizes other GIS layers
to obtain the correct response zone and assign the correct city code. The City
of Champaign Fire Department currently utilizes the street centerline data in
their system. The C-U MTD and the Champaign Urbana Public Health District are
also planning to use the CCGIS Consortium data in their emergency applications.

### Carle Hospital/C-U MTD Memorandum of Understanding
In March 2007, a memorandum of understanding was signed between C-U MTD and
Carle Hospital, which will provide for patients to be transported to C-U MTD’s
main warehouse and garage in Urbana for temporary care in the event of a
large-scale local disaster. Patients would be provided temporary care at these
locations until they are discharged or moved to Carle or other hospitals in the
state.

### Champaign County Emergency Management Agency (EMA)
The Champaign County Emergency Management Agency is the local Emergency Services
and Disaster Agency (ESDA) for the county. The agency is located at 1905 E. Main
Street in Urbana. This facility also houses the Emergency Operations Center
(EOC) and the METCAD 911 center. One of the primary functions of Champaign
County EMA is to provide severe weather event coordination through an
established network of storm spotters across the county providing advance
warnings of severe weather. Local communities’ EMAs also have their own spotters
who report severe weather conditions in and around their communities.

Spotters are in constant communication with the EOC which is at the center of
all EMA operations providing monitoring and communications, monitoring weather
conditions and relaying information to other public agencies during severe
weather. The Champaign County EMA also provides emergency field communications
through the mobile command post E1, which is a mobile communications and command
center with capabilities to communicate on any public safety frequency in
Champaign County.

### Hazardous Material and Commodity Flows Study
In 2014, CUUATS staff began a hazardous material and commodity flows study to
document what types of hazardous materials are transported on area highways and
roadways and stored around the region. This study will include the
identification of possible vulnerable locations along existing routes (e.g.
schools) and make recommendations for different routes, if necessary, to
minimize potential exposure for vulnerable locations in the event of a crash or
spill.

### Illinois Emergency Management Agency (EMA)
The Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) is responsible for coordination,
mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery operations during disasters in
the State of Illinois. IEMA has its central office in Springfield, IL, and eight
regional offices. Through regional coordinators, IEMA assists local, county, and
municipal ESDAs; public officials; and other organizations in managing disaster
events. Champaign County is located in IEMA Region 7.

### Illinois Homeland Security
Located in Springfield, Illinois Homeland Security is the state office of the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The mission of this organization is for a
better prepared state of Illinois in homeland security. This agency coordinates
with other federal and state agencies such as the Illinois Terrorism Task Force,
(ITTF), and the Illinois Department of Public Health, (IDPH), in dealing with
security related incidents in the state. The ITTF has divided the state into 12
regions based on six criteria: population; existing state and regional response
divisions; existing technical and specialist local, regional, and state response
teams; critical infrastructure; minimum response times; and in-depth
overlapping/secondary/tertiary regional and statewide coverage. Champaign County
is in Region 12, along with Iroquois, Ford and Vermilion counties. This agency
provides training for emergency responders and public officials including:

* Unified Command Workshops – providing a basic understanding of incident command,
unified command and the National Incident Management System (NIMS). The target
audience for these workshops includes public works and highway department
officials.

* Response Guide for Incidents, Disasters and Emergencies (RGIDE) – this training,
provided by Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), is for transportation
field personnel to be aware of biological, nuclear, incendiary, chemical
explosives, bridge failure, and natural disasters.

* Public Works: Preparing for and Responding to Terrorism/Weapons of Mass
Destruction – this workshop provided by the Illinois Municipal League focuses on
challenges facing public works and emergency responders when dealing with
security related incidents as an integrated effort in their communities.

## Illinois Homeland Security Research Center (IHSRC)
The Illinois Homeland Security Research Center was established in January 2004
by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The center’s focus is on
fostering interdisciplinary collaboration in homeland security research and
technology. The center also provides training classes for emergency responders.
The center’s objectives are:

* Defining and addressing critical challenges
* Supporting first responders
* Providing authoritative and unbiased review of emerging technologies
* Conducting action-oriented, applied research as well as long-term fundamental
research to support homeland security and the War on Terror
* Creating and transferring knowledge to other researchers, first responders and
policy makers
* Aiding in applying technologies from the laboratory in the private sector
