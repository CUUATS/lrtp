The Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area is a diverse region spanning 47 square miles
and containing a population of more than 145,000 people in east-central
Illinois. The region is located 135 miles south of Chicago, IL, 120 miles west
of Indianapolis, IN, and 180 miles northeast of Saint Louis, MO. Five
municipalities are partially or wholly within the Champaign-Urbana Urbanized
Area: City of Champaign, City of Urbana, Village of Savoy, Village of Tolono,
and Village of Bondville. In contrast, the Metropolitan Planning Area (MPA) is
the 25-year planning area for the long range transportation plan. The MPA spans
179 square miles and includes the Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area as well as the
Village of Mahomet and some rural areas of Champaign County. The MPA is used to
determine which areas will develop in a contiguous manner to the urbanized area
over the next 25 years, (Figure 3.1).1

### City of Champaign
The City of Champaign is the most populous and geographically largest
municipality in the urbanized area. As of 2010, Champaign had a population of
81,055 and currently covers nearly 23 square miles.

### City of Urbana
The City of Urbana is the second most populous and second largest municipality
in the urbanized area. As of 2010, Urbana had a population of 41,250 and
currently covers nearly 12 square miles.

### Village of Savoy
The Village of Savoy is the third most populous and third largest municipality
in the urbanized area. As of 2010, Savoy had a population of 7,280 and currently
covers three square miles.

### Village of Bondville
The Village of Bondville is located approximately two miles west of the City of
Champaign on Illinois Route 10. It is the least populous and smallest of the
municipalities in the urbanized area. As of 2010, Bondville had a population of
443 and currently covers 0.3 square miles.

### Village of Tolono
The Village of Tolono was added to the Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area in 2010.
As of 2010, Tolono had a population of 3,447 and currently covers two square
miles.

### Village of Mahomet
The Village of Mahomet is located approximately ten miles west of the City of
Champaign on Interstate 74. As of 2010, Mahomet had a population of 7,259 and
currently covers about 7 square miles.

## General Population Characteristics
According to the 2010 Census, Champaign County, Illinois has a population of
201,081 people. About 72-percent (145,361) of these residents reside within the
Champaign-Urbana Urbanized Area, consisting of 53,944 households and an average
household size of 2.2 persons.

### Age
The 2010 Census shows that the largest group of residents in the urbanized area
is between 20 and 29 years of age (Figure 3.2), which includes students at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There are more males in the age
groups from 0 to 39 years of age, and more females in the age groups from 40 to
80+ years of age. This trend is generally the same as was seen in the 2000
Census population for the urbanized area.

### Race and Ethnicity

The majority of the urbanized area population is white, although the percentage
of white population has fallen 5.7 percent since 2000 (Table 3.1). The second
largest racial group is black or African Americans, which has increased 3.6
percent since 2000. Asians are the third largest racial group with the highest
increase in percentage of the total population since 2000, with 5.4 percent. The
urbanized area and the county show similar trends in Hispanic versus
non-Hispanic populations, which are 6 and 94 percent, respectively. For the
Hispanic population of the urbanized area, this is a 2.5 percent increase in the
percentage of the total population since 2000.

## Education, Income, Poverty, and Disability
According to the 2010 American Community Survey (ACS), nearly 94 percent of the
population in the urbanized area has a high school diploma or higher (Table
3.2). Of this population, 50.5 percent has a bachelor’s degree or higher. This
is a two-percent increase in persons with at least a high school diploma and a
three-percent increase of persons with a bachelor’s d or higher since 2000. This
illustrates that the urbanized area generally has a highly educated population
compared to the state and the nation overall due to the presence of the
University of Illinois.

### Median Income
Median income is a valuable indicator for the transportation options available
to residents. However, in a college town where institutional and family grants
and loans are commonly used to cover student educational and living expenses,
income is not easily measured or compared accross different populations. The
U.S. Census defines ‘household’ income as excluding students living in group
quarters, but not those living in households. Table 3.3 indicates that Savoy has
the highest household income for the region at $50,000 per year and the highest
householder income for the age range 45-65 at nearly $90,000 per year.
Generally, householders in the area from 15-24 years of age have the lowest
median income due to the large student population, with income generally rising
from the 24-44 to the 45-64 age bracket. As householders retire, incomes begin
to fall again, although not to the point of householders in the 15-24 age
bracket.

title="Median Household Income (2010)"
source="US Census Bureau, ACS 5-Yr Data, (Table DP03)">}}

### Poverty Status by Age
As part of the planning process, concentrations of targeted population groups
were identified, including elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities
(Table 3.4), and persons with low incomes (Table 3.5). This information is
relevant when developing and evaluating transit plans, which requires careful
analysis of the mobility needs of the population and potential ridership for
transit services. Between 2000 and 2010, the US Census Bureau changed its
methodology for collecting income and poverty data**. Table 3.5 shows that the
rate of poverty for each age category was relatively consistent between 2000 and
2010, with an overall increase in the number of people living below the poverty
level. Similar to measuring income, poverty levels can be difficult to measure
and compare due to the fact that students are sometimes inaccurately defined as
‘living below poverty level’ because of the difficulty in measuring their
non-traditional forms of income and financial support.

Due to rounding, totals may not equal 100.
In a comparison study between Census 2000 income data and the 2000 ACS, income collected in Census 2000 was found
to be about 4 percent higher than that in the 2000 ACS. For more information on the differences of income in the ACS
and Census 2000, see Income in the American Community Survey: Comparison to Census 2000. (www.census.gov)">}}

### Households
Household size is an indicator of population distribution and density within the
urbanized area. One-person households grew by nearly 3,000 households
(approximately three percent) between 2000 and 2010, which illustrates an
increasing prevalence of people living alone in the area (Table 3.6). The
remainder of the household sizes generally grew in number but remained
consistent in percent of total households, except for 5-person households and
2-person households.

### Urban-Rural Ratio
The urbanized area grew from 123,938 people in 2000 to 145,361 people in 2010.
The urbanized area also grew by more than eight square miles from 2000 to 2010
with a continued trend of nearly three-percent shift from rural to urban land
designation per decade in Champaign County from 1980 to 2010 (Table 3.7).

## Employment
Champaign County is a regional employment center because of the presence of
educational, health care, and manufacturing employers in the area. According to
the Illinois Department of Employment Security, (IDES), the unemployment rate
decreased from 8.2 to 8 percent during the period 2009-2011 despite a reduction
of over 5,000 workers in the labor force. According to the IDES, the top five
employment sectors for 2011 were:

1. Educational Services – 19,120 workers
2. Health Care and Social Assistance – 11,514 workers
3. Retail Trade – 8,996 workers
4. Accommodation and Food Services – 8,606 workers
5. Manufacturing – 7,554 workers

Several of the companies within the top five industries in Champaign County have
shown growth since 2009 (Table 3.8). For example, the University of Illinois and
Carle have both hired over 300 new employees since 2009. Other companies such as
Kraft Foods, Inc., Plastipak Packaging, Inc., and Christie Clinic have
experienced a small growth in employees in the same time period. Parkland
College and Provena Covenant Medical Center have each lost more than 200
employees since 2009.

One of the most frequent trips made within the Metropolitan Planning Area (MPA)
is area residents’ journey to work, determined on a large scale by population
and employment locations. Consequently, population and employment are critical
factors in planning for a more sustainable, equitable, and efficient
transportation network, as well as upholding the vision and goals listed in
Sustainable Choices 2040. Effectively planning for future changes in population
and employment can result in many benefits, including reduced vehicle miles
travelled (VMT), travel time, and traffic congestion as well as increased
accessibility, air quality, and household spending power.

## Traveling in the Urbanized Area

Mode choice and vehicle availability for workers are important factors used to
assess the need for the provision of alternatives to the automobile. These data
also provide information on the prevalence of automobiles in the region. In the
urbanized area, more than 4,000 people (or seven percent) of the working
population do not have access to a personal vehicle. Champaign and Urbana have a
higher rate of no-vehicle ownership than the rest of the urbanized area at 7.5
and 8.4 percent, respectively, compared with an average of 7 percent for the
entire urbanized area.

Table 3.10 shows the commuter mode for workers in
urbanized areas across the Midwest. The Champaign-Urbana urbanized area has the
highest percentage of drivers and carpoolers, but also has a high percentage of
workers who take public transportation and walk, although the numbers in these
categories have decreased for the urbanized area overall since Tolono,
Bondville, and the southern portion of Savoy don’t have access to public
transportation.

Table 3.11 shows the commuting mode for workers by municipality within the
urbanized area. Champaign and Urbana have the highest percentages of workers who
use public transportation, walk, or bicycle in the region and the lowest numbers
of people who drive. The Cities of Urbana and Champaign, and the University of
Illinois have been designated Bicycle Friendly Communities/University by the
League of American Bicyclists. In addition, the City of Urbana was ranked 15th
among all small cities in the nation (with population between 20,000 and 99,999)
in percent of residents who bike or walk to work. Savoy, Tolono, and Bondville
have high levels of people who drive alone or carpool to work.

Table 3.12 shows travel time to work for workers in the region. In Champaign,
Urbana, and Savoy, a majority of workers have less than a 15-minute commute. In
Tolono and Bondville, most workers have a commute between 15 and 29 minutes.
Overall, the mean travel time in the urbanized area is less than 20 minutes.
